losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002.
This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can
be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is
now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the
license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use".  Otherwise, this version is
the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free
Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification
under the Open Source Definition.  Please see our Copyright FAQ for common

 *
 *      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 *      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

 *          as modifying the License.
 *
 *      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

 *
 *   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

 *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation
       or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled 
       object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object 
      form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright 
      notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is 
      provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object 
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the 
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces 
      of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original 
      version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or

      communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated 
      in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity 
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and 
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright 
      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, 
      publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such 
      Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
      License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, 
      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated 
      in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
      sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,  where such license 
      applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor 
      that are necessarily infringed by their  Contribution(s) alone or by 
      combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such 
      Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation 
      against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a 
      lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within 
      the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then 
      any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work 
      shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work 
      or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,
      and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following
      conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works 
      a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices 
      stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that 
      You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices 
      from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not 
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
      then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy
      of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding 
      those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in 
      at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed 
      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, 
      if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated 
      by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally 
      appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only 
      and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices 
      within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to 
      the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution 
      notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
      additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, 
      or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a
      whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
      complies with the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any 
      Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to 
      the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without 
      any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein 
      shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may 
      have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, 
      trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required 
      for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and 
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in 
      writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its 
      Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF 
      ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any 
      warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining 
      the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any 
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether 
      in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by 
      applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to 
      in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including 
      any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
      character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability 
      to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, 
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other 
      commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised 
      of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work 
      or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, 
      acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations 
      and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such 
      obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
      responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
      agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any 
      liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by 
      reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

GNU Lesser General Public License

Version 2.1, February 1999

    Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
    as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
    the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too, but we
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are
informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other
code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients,
so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the
library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know
their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method:  (1) we copyright the library,
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected
by problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria
of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to
protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as
widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General
Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified
version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library".  The former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0.  This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public
License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been
distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the Library" means either the
Library or any derivative work under copyright law:  that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program using
the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if
its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of
the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1.  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along
with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2.  You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you
changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data
to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as
an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith
effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function
or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose
remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that
is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection
2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this
function must be optional:  if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the
Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

3.  You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make
any other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into
a program that is not a library.

4.  You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.

5.  A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called
a "work that uses the Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative
work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library".  The executable is
therefore covered by this License.  Section 6 states terms for distribution of
such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
the Library even though the source code is not.  Whether this is true is
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the
work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in
length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether
it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.  Any executables
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
directly with the Library itself.

6.  As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of
the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You
must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.
Also, you must do one of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which
must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work
that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can
modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents
of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile
the application to use the modified definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library
functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge
no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials
from the same place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that
you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from
it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.
Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in
an executable that you distribute.

7.  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed
under the terms of the Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it
is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work.

8.  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who
have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9.  You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or
any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10.  Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

11.  If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

12.  If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.

13.  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
Lesser General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

14.  If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15.  BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16.  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  END OF TERMS AND
CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA 

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary.  Here is
a sample; alter the names:

    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
    the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written
    by James Random Hacker.

    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990

    Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!


      unRAR restriction
      -----------------

        The unRAR sources cannot be used to re-create the RAR compression
algorithm, 
        which is proprietary. Distribution of modified unRAR sources in separate
form 
        or as a part of other software is permitted, provided that it is clearly
        stated in the documentation and source comments that the code may
        not be used to develop a RAR (WinRAR) compatible archiver.

ABSTRACT
========

   UPX and UCL are copyrighted software distributed under the terms
   of the GNU General Public License (hereinafter the "GPL").

   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part
   of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing
   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.

   As a special exception we grant the free usage of UPX for all
   executables, including commercial programs.
   See below for details and restrictions.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
==========================

   UPX and the UCL library are free software; you can redistribute them
   and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
   published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of
   the License, or (at your option) any later version.

   UPX and UCL are distributed in the hope that they will be useful,
   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
   GNU General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
   along with this program; see the file COPYING.


SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR COMPRESSED EXECUTABLES
============================================

   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part
   of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing
   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.

   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special
   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs
   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:

   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX
      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)
      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as
      distributed by us.
   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.
      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical
      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.
   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get
      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at
      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,
      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.


ANNOTATIONS
===========

  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for
    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.

  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX
    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,
    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your
    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to
    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.

  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use
    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we
    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects
    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -
    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious
    by definition.

  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that
    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant
    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.

  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and
    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to
    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.
